Let’s not use the default AlertController in our upcoming iOS Apps because it doesn’t feel awesome. To make the alert look better and customised, I just created Common Repo which can be used very easily for all kind of Alerts. So, let’s use this from now on.


# Simple and easy alerts to use instead of default AlertController.

# Separate Xib is provided to customize as per your need. 

# Integrate Framework file without writing a single line of code. 

# Callbacks are easily handled by using Closures.

# Usage -  It's simpler than anything: You can use it in two ways

# 1. Use Framework:

    Simply Clone/Download the repository and drag KAlert.framework file into your project.
    
    import KAlert in your file where you want to use it.And That's it..!
            

# 2. Use Code:

# Simply Drag and drop CustomAlert folder in your project. that's it...

# Use following samples to use this simple alert

# For Simple one: 
```swift
self.showCustomAlertWith(
    message: "This is a simple alert with a logo and message",
    descMsg: "",
    itemimage: nil,
    actions: nil)
```                    

# Simple one with callback action on OK button: 
```swift
let actionYes: () -> Void = { (
    print("tapped OK")
) }
self.showCustomAlertWith(
    okButtonAction: actionYes, // This is optional
    message: "This is a simple alert with a logo and message",
    descMsg: "",
    itemimage: nil,
    actions: nil)
```

# For More Content: 

```swift
let actionYes : [String: () -> Void] = [ "YES" : { (
        print("tapped YES")
) }]
let actionNo : [String: () -> Void] = [ "No" : { (
    print("tapped NO")
) }]
let arrayActions = [actionYes, actionNo]

self.showCustomAlertWith(
    message: "This is an alert with a logo, message, additional icon, description, and 2 buttons with handlers",
    descMsg: "your description goes here. Change font size from XiB file.",
    itemimage: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "icon"),
    actions: arrayActions)
```
